We also do our best to pay our employees living wages <br />(tips are shared with all employees, including kitchen staff) and to reduce <br />our environmental footprint wherever we can. Overall, these factors<br /> translate to higher menu prices, but we hope that you find value and <br />feel a sense of comfort in knowing
                            that we aim to get better <br />everyday at doing what is important to us.</div>
